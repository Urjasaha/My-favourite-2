      <p> My hobby is art. Apart from making websites, games and apps; I adore drawing and painting. Before, when I was younger I thought of Art as a waste. But soon I learned more and more ways of expressing it. I soon understood that art wasn't just drawing and painting a random picture. You can do much more with it, and I also realized that oil pastels aren't my thing. </p>
